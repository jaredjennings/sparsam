This script will clear transactions and load envelopes from a budget.

The budget should be a Gnumeric spreadsheet file. It should have pairs of
left/right adjacent cells highlighted in light cyan. For example, the
spreadsheet may say:


  /--+------------+-----------+-\
  |  | *Clothing* |  *$50.00* | |
  \--+------------+-----------+-/

where the stars indicate light cyan highlighting. For each such pair of cells,
the script will create an envelope.

It's assumed that the web server serving Sparsam uses Kerberos, and the same
realm as you used when you logged into the workstation you're running the
script on.
